        <h2 class="article-title"> WAN port doesn't work? </h2>
        <p class="article-text-intro">
            Instead of replacing your router, You can try to convert one of the LAN ports into a WAN Port. This may or may not work for you depending on the model of your router, and availability of a firmware that you can install on it. But, it is something to consider if you don't feel like throwing out a functioning router just because of a faulty WAN port.
        </p>
        <p class="article-text-intro">
            Besides, if converting a LAN port into a WAN port doesn't work for you, you can always use your Router as a Wireless Access Point (AP) to improve Wifi coverage along with your new router or as a Switch to connect your devices via a LAN cable for a fast reliable physical link.

            I will explain the process for a <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/en/home-networking/wifi-router/archer-c20/v4/">TP-Link Archer C20 Version 4.1</a>, which is the model that I have with a non-functioning WAN Port.

            <h4>
                How does one find the version of the router?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Usually the manufacturer provides the method to identify the version. It is most commonly printed near the product serial code on the back of the router itself. For the TP-link router I am demonstrating here, the hardware version is 4.1 as seen in the screenshot.
